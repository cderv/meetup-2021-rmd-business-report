Guidelines are usually colors, fonts, size but can also be document template.

We'll try cover most formats from HTML to Office Document

???

We often see these rmarkdown little wizard mixing Text & Code to produce document. Aim is to look deeper into this today. This is not so magic. It is juts perceived magic and there are tools to know about under the hood to be able to customize behavior further. And it is important to know about this for styling.

.center[![:scale 75%, Diagram showing the different step of rendering, using knitr first from Rmd to md, then Pandoc from md to output format like HTML, DOC and PDF (using LaTeX)](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/images/workflow.png)]

.box.f3[`knitr::knit()` + `Pandoc` (+ `LaTeX`) = `rmarkdown::render()`]

???

rmarkdown will run Pandoc & knitr for you so one input for multiple output possible. 
But stylings is specific to the output. 

This is important to know all this because it helps know where to look and what could be tweak. one has to understand what to tweak to make something works as expected.

.center-middle[
> While **HTML** is used to define the **structure and semantics** of your content, **CSS** is used to **style it and lay it out**.  
> For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

# Use CSS from inside a Rmd file

.subtitle[About the `css` chunk engine]

````markdown
```{css, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
/* add a blue border */
div.mybox {
  border-color: blue;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0.5em;
}

/* Set to blue bold text inside the box */
div.mybox strong {
  color: blue;
}
```
````

Applied directly in the Rmd document without an external css file 

???

Useful for prototyping, for quick iteration, for single file example
echo = false is important if you don't want to show CSS source chunk in output

# Use SASS the same way

.subtitle[About the `sass`/`scss` engine]

---

### What is SASS ?

Sass (https://sass-lang.com) is a CSS extension language that allows you to create CSS rules in much more flexible ways than you would do with plain CSS.
</br>
</br>
.center[![:scale 20%](https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo-b6e1ef6e.svg)]

It allows for variables, tweaking functions (called _mixins_), operations (like `/`), better CSS rule organisation (nesting, extensions, ...) and more.

???

External tool used by web developers. Very powerful and this is a skill to learn when doing a lot of HTML. It can do a lot ! 

But no need to use it directly. Still need to learn the feature and syntax.

---
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[previous css]

````markdown
```{css, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
div.mybox {
* border-color: blue;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0.5em;
}

div.mybox strong {
* color: blue;
}
```
````

]

.panel[.panel-name[scss]
````markdown
```{scss, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
*$color1: blue;

div {
  &.mybox {
*   border-color: $color1;
    border-style: solid;
    padding: 0.5em;

    strong {
*     color: $color1;
    }
  }
}
```
````
]
]

???

The CSS is the one that would be render when using sass on the .scss or .sass file. 

No preference on the syntax - it is a personnal choice (and depending on environment.)

.box[Support is now built-in **rmarkdown**]

]

???

Quite new. Allow to use SASS from R. Wrapper around a C library.

Supported in rmarkdown now.

---

External `.scss` file can also be passed in the `css` argument of most output format like `html_document()`

</br>

````yaml
output:
  html_document:
    css: custom-style.scss
````

.pb3[
The file will be processed internally by `sass::sass_file()` and produce a `.css` automatically.
]

.box[Using a `.scss` file makes it easier to use variables and rules in CSS.  
Use variables to store style guide values and use theme in several places.]

???

You can do much more with SASS. It pushes the limit of customization of a document.

How to use it ? Why this CSS example ?

# Use custom blocks to style

```{cat, opts.label ='cat_md'}

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.mybox-demo {
  border-color: blue;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0.5em;
}

.mybox-demo strong {
  color: blue;
}
```

.pb3[
With the previous style applied, it will result in this box in the document
]
.pb3[
.mybox-demo[
Special **important** content
]
]
```{r demo-box, echo = FALSE, results='asis', rm_temp = TRUE}
o <- tempfile()
rmarkdown::pandoc_convert(temp_file, to = "html", output = I(o))
content <- xfun::read_utf8(o)
unlink(o)
```

```{cat, engine.opts = list(lang = "html"), code = content}
```

???

Pandoc feature. R Markdown knows and extend it. 
Quite simple to write but quite powerful. 

Supported by Visual editor.

---

Attributes and id can be added too, e.g


```{cat, opts.label ='cat_md'}
::: {.mybox #box1 style="text-align: center;"}
Special **important** content
:::
```

.pb3[
The above add inline style to the div
]
.pb3[
.center.mybox-demo[
Special **important** content
]
]
```{r, include = FALSE, rm_temp = TRUE}
o <- tempfile()
rmarkdown::pandoc_convert(temp_file, to = "html", output = I(o))
content <- xfun::read_utf8(o)
unlink(o)
```

```{cat, engine.opts = list(lang = "html"), code = content}
```

???

Allow to style mainly.

# Going further with Bootstrap

.subtitle[Powered by the new **bslib** R `r emo::ji("package")`]

[**bslib**](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bslib) provides tools for customizing [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) themes directly from R. It allows take custom theming easier and provide easy access to pre-packaged Bootswatch themes.

.pull-left[
Supported in R Markdown output format:
* `rmarkdown::html_document()` .small[(using `theme` argument)]
* `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard()` .small[(current dev version > 0.5.2)]
* `bookdown::bs4_book()` built on Bootstrap 4
]

.pull-right[
Supported in other tools:
* **DT** (since 0.18)
* **shiny** (since 1.6.0)
* **pkgdown** (current dev version > 1.6.1)
]

**rmarkdown** still don't use **bslib** by default: Simple example to activate Bootstrap 4 in `html_document()` with **bslib** and default style

```yaml
output:
  html_document:
    theme: 
      version: 4

      secondary: "#4D4D4D"               # Changing secondary to grey
      blockquote-border-color: "#FDBE4B" # Styling specific blockquote part to yellow
      lightblue: "#75AADB"               # definining another blue as variable to reuse
      code-color: "$lightblue"           # inline code color will be blue
      border-color: "$lightblue"         # as default border color
      border-width: "3px"                # increasing border width
      warning: "#E7553C"                 # warning-like text will be orange 
      info: "#A4C689"                    # info like text will be green

.subtitle[How to apply custom style ?]

Using [Div & Spans](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) from Pandoc Markdown syntax.

.fl.w-50.pr5[
Using fenced div attributes  
for Paragraph style
````markdown
::: {custom-style="highlight-box"}
The **`r knitr::inline_expr("heaviest_specie")`** specie is heavier than other ! 
:::
````
]

.fl.w-50.pl5[
Using Spans attributes  
for Text style:
```markdown
[One of the species lives on all islands]{custom-style="Emphatically"} and the others are specific to one island only. 
```
]

This will associate Docx Styles name to the text. Style can then be modified in template.

# What about PDF output ?

.subtitle[Producing PDF]


## Creating PDF through LaTeX 

Styling needs to be done using TeX styling mechanism, with help of CTAN packages.

## Creating PDF through HTML

`r emo::ji("tada")` CSS can be used ! 

Two solutions: 

1. Printing document as-is

2. Formating and Styling HTML specically for printing (using Paged Media CSS)
